# memlib.sh -- shared helpers for MemContinuum's write-side reminder hooks
# (ledger-post-edit.sh, precompact-persist.sh, sessionstart-remind.sh,
# userprompt-remind.sh, sessionend-stamp.sh). Source this from each hook
# script; it is never executed standalone.
#
# Contract mirrors pre-edit-chain.sh (docs/DESIGN.md SS8 / docs/DESIGN.md
# ruling F): hard-clear PYTHONPATH, absolute venv python, MEMCONTINUUM_* env,
# a single hook.log, fail-open on every path. Every hook that sources this is
# still individually responsible for its own final `exit 0` -- memlib.sh never
# exits or traps on the caller's behalf.
#
# macOS port (docs/DESIGN.md SS8 port note, 2026-08-30): stock macOS bash is
# 3.2 and ships neither `flock` nor `timeout`. This file used to shell out to
# both; it no longer uses either anywhere. Locking now lives inside the one
# python process mc_update_state_json already spawns (real fcntl.flock, a 2s
# non-blocking-retry deadline, atomic tmp+rename write, see below). The
# overall per-call deadline that `timeout 2` used to provide is now the job
# of each CALLING hook script's own watchdog guard (a tiny python launcher
# that runs the whole script in its own process group and kills the group on
# a 2s budget -- see the top of each hooks/*.sh file) -- so no helper in this
# file wraps its own subprocess calls in any per-call timeout any more; the
# caller's watchdog bounds the entire run, including every helper call made
# along the way.
#
# Env (project-agnostic; concrete values belong only in project wiring, e.g.
# .claude/settings.json or a *.json.example next to it -- never in this repo):

#   MEMCONTINUUM_ROOT        store markdown root (the decision-chain repo).
#   MEMCONTINUUM_CODE_ROOT   code root these hooks watch edits under (single-
#                        root fallback; see MEMCONTINUUM_CODE_ROOTS below).
#   MEMCONTINUUM_CODE_ROOTS  JSON array of every configured code root's
#                        physical path (design R5, audit MC-P1-05, TOP-0123
#                        L5). mc_code_roots() reads this first and falls
#                        back to the single MEMCONTINUUM_CODE_ROOT above
#                        when unset, so a project with one root never needs

# below): shifts .1..KEEP-1 up to .2..KEEP (dropping whatever sat at .KEEP,
# highest N first so a shift never overwrites a file before that file
# itself has been shifted along), then lands SRC at the now-free .1. Every
# shift step is independently fail-open (`|| true`) -- a single missing/
# unmovable link in the middle of the chain must never abort the ones
# after it; only the final `mv "$SRC" .1` result is ever surfaced to the
# caller.
#
# The shift only ever runs when .1 currently exists (round-2 review
# finding, MINOR -- Grok's worked example): if .1 is already missing, this
# is either the ordinary first-ever-rotation case (every slot below KEEP is
# empty too, so the shift would be an all-no-op regardless) OR a PRIOR call
# already shifted this exact chain to completion and was interrupted before
# landing its own SRC -- the shift loop's last step (n=1) is the one that
# vacates .1, so .1 missing is precisely the signal that "nothing is left
# to shift, only the land step remains". Running the shift AGAIN in that
# second case would shift the ALREADY-shifted chain a second time and drop
# one extra in-window file that should have survived (exactly the bug the
# finding describes: KEEP=3, .1/.2/.3 = A/B/C, a claim's shift completes
# in full -- B lands at .3 dropping C, A lands at .2, .1 now empty -- then
# the process is killed before landing its own SRC at .1; if the next
# rotation blindly re-shifted, it would move .2's A to .3, dropping B,
# which had every right to survive). When .1 IS present, the shift below
# is always safe to run unconditionally even over a PARTIALLY completed
# prior shift, because every already-vacated slot's own `[ -f ... ]` check
# makes that step a harmless no-op the second time through. KEEP=1 makes
# the loop itself a no-op (n starts at 0) regardless of this guard, so the
# final mv lands directly on .1 exactly as the original two-file-total code

# mc_rotate_hook_log -- eval-topic-logging section 5 (owner-approved
# add-on): nothing truncates or prunes hook.log on its own
# (mc_prune_old_state only ever clears session-state JSON) -- measured on a
# real machine, ~177 KB/day, so it grows unbounded without this, and every
# `memidx.py stats` run reads the whole file cold. If $MC_LOG is larger
# than MEMCONTINUUM_LOG_MAX_BYTES (default 5242880 = 5 MiB), it is rotated:
# the chain hook.log.1 (newest) .. hook.log.$MEMCONTINUUM_LOG_KEEP (oldest)
# is shifted up by one (.N -> .N+1, oldest dropped), then $MC_LOG's current
# content becomes the new hook.log.1 and a fresh, empty $MC_LOG is created.
# MEMCONTINUUM_LOG_KEEP (default 12) bounds how many rotated files are ever
# kept -- no file beyond .$MEMCONTINUUM_LOG_KEEP, no dated archive, no
# compression; data older than the oldest retained file is gone by design
# (memidx.py stats reads every hook.log.N it finds, N=1..KEEP, alongside
# hook.log itself). Lowering MEMCONTINUUM_LOG_KEEP is honored on the very
# next rotation: anything now beyond the new, smaller bound is pruned (see
# below), not merely left unreferenced. MEMCONTINUUM_LOG_KEEP=1 reproduces
# the pre-this-feature, hook.log.1-only policy exactly (hook.log.1 always
# replaced, never a .2). Sizing rationale: a real store's live hook.log
# measured ~5 MB of growth in 21 days (~240 KB/day), so the default
# 12 x 5 MiB bound gives roughly 8-9 months of retained history at that
# rate -- bounded and documented, not "archive forever" (an external
# review ruled out unbounded retention; this is the sized alternative).
#
# Called ONLY from sessionstart-remind.sh's own startup/resume/clear
# branch, once per session -- NEVER from mc_log above, or from
# pre-edit-chain.sh's own independent logger, both of which are hot append
# paths that must not gain a stat() call for this.
#
# Fail-open, like every other path in this file: a missing/unwritable
# $MEMCONTINUUM_HOME, a size that can't be read, or a concurrent session
# racing this same check all leave the log alone and return 0 -- this is
# best-effort housekeeping, never a correctness guarantee, and must never
# raise or block the calling hook. The rename-to-a-pid-unique-temp-name
# step below (rather than a direct `mv "$MC_LOG" "$MC_LOG.1"`) means at
# most ONE of two sessions racing this same rotation ever wins: the
# loser's own `mv "$MC_LOG" ...` simply fails (the winner already moved
# it) and returns cleanly -- only the winner ever reaches the shift logic
# below, so there is no shift-vs-shift race to guard against either.

    # (nothing ever lands at .1 except through this same claim-and-shift

    # own single shift-and-land call, reproduces exactly the chain an

    # This is best-effort ordering, not a strict guarantee (round-2 review
    # NIT): if an earlier sweep skipped an orphan because its pid had been
    # recycled by an unrelated live process (a live-looking pid that isn't
    # really the original claim's), that orphan is left for a LATER
    # rotation to recover, and it can then land ahead of windows that were

# to be duplicated byte-for-byte in userprompt-remind.sh and
# precompact-persist.sh; now lives here once. CODE_HEADS is
# mc_code_heads_from's own output ("root<TAB>head\n" lines); STATE_FILE's
# `start_code_shas` ({root: sha}) is the per-root map sessionstart-remind.sh
# writes; `start_code_sha` (singular) is the pre-multi-root legacy value,
# recorded only for the FIRST configured root (repo-init.sh always renders
# MEMCONTINUUM_CODE_ROOT as code_roots[0] whenever any code root is
# configured, so FIRST_ROOT == that value identifies the one root the
# legacy key was ever measuring).
#
# LOW-4 fix (task-7-review.md): a root OTHER than FIRST_ROOT that is
# missing from `start_code_shas` (the transitional window before a resume
# repopulates the map -- see sessionstart-remind.sh's own header comment)
# is treated as UNKNOWN and skipped, never compared against a DIFFERENT
# root's start sha -- the pre-fix fallback compared every such root's
# current HEAD against the first root's own start sha (two unrelated git
# repositories), which could only ever read as a false "changed: yes".
#
# MOVED_ROOTS (TOP-0122 L1 rule 2a, the commit nudge): a SEPARATE, per-
# PROMPT comparison against `last_seen_heads` ({root: sha}, distinct from
# the per-SESSION `start_code_shas` above) -- folded into this same read
# (one state-file load, one CODE_HEADS scan) purely so the common "nothing
# moved" turn costs userprompt-remind.sh no extra python spawn at all. This
# is a CHEAP GATE only, not the authoritative decision: a root missing from
# `last_seen_heads` is treated as unknown and never reported moved (mirrors
# the LOW-4 policy above), and the caller re-derives the real comparison
# (and does the actual bookkeeping write) from a freshly-loaded state
# inside its own locked transform before acting on it -- this avoids ever
# trusting a value read outside a lock as the basis for a write.

# mc_update_state_json STATE_FILE PY_TRANSFORM [DEADLINE_SECONDS]
#
# The one shared "lock + atomic-rename JSON update" primitive. Everything --
# acquiring the lock, loading the existing state, running the transform, and
# the atomic write -- happens inside ONE python process (macOS port: no
# `flock`/`timeout` binary involved anywhere). That process:
#   1. opens STATE_FILE.lock and takes a real fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX), retried
#      non-blocking every ~20ms up to DEADLINE_SECONDS (default 2.0, every
#      pre-existing caller's own unchanged behavior) -- exits 97 (mapped to
#      outcome=lock-timeout below) if the deadline passes without the lock.
#      Re-gate round 3, MAJOR 1: a caller whose OWN total budget is tight
#      (the search fallback's titling write, running under the SAME 2s
#      watchdog its query already spent most of) passes a short
#      DEADLINE_SECONDS instead of eating the full 2.0s default -- see
#      hooks/mc-fallback-lib.sh's own mc_fallback_write_state, the ONE
#      caller that does this today.
#   2. loads STATE_FILE (or {} if missing/corrupt/unreadable) into `state`.
#   3. runs PY_TRANSFORM (spliced in verbatim at column 0, exactly as
#      before) against it -- it may read any MC_*-prefixed env var the
#      caller exported beforehand, and must end by printing the new,
#      complete state object via `print(json.dumps(state))` (or print
#      nothing / exit non-zero to make this a no-op write).
#   4. via an atexit hook registered before the transform runs (so it fires
#      whether the transform falls through normally, calls sys.exit(N), or
#      raises), writes whatever was printed to a tmp file and os.replace()s
#      it onto STATE_FILE -- but only if something was actually printed --
#      then releases the lock.
# The transform never sees the existing state through an exported env var or
# argv (only via the `state` dict already loaded into that same process) --
# so a legacy or otherwise-sensitive key already sitting in a caller's
# persisted state (e.g. a pre-fingerprint-scheme raw prompt_id) is never
# inherited by any subprocess that python spawns (re-gate finding, HIGH; the
# same class of bug as dual-gate review finding 1, but for the EXISTING
# state rather than the incoming payload).
#
# Returns the transform's exit code (0 on a normal, evaluated write; a lock
# failure returns 1 after logging outcome=lock-timeout / outcome=lock-open-
# failed). A caller that also needs a *value* out of the transform (not just
# the persisted state) should have the transform write that value to a
# side-channel file of its own choosing (e.g. one named by an MC_*_OUT env
# var) and read it back itself afterward -- this function's own stdout/
# return value carries no such value.
