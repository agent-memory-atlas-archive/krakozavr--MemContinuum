#!/usr/bin/env bash
# mc-query-lib.sh -- pure, side-effect-free helpers that turn an edited
# FILE_PATH into a small bag of search words: the query the search-fallback
# channel (TOP-0133 L1) hands to `memidx.py search` when a pre-edit lookup
# (hooks/pre-edit-chain.sh) or a new-file nudge (hooks/newfile-nudge.sh)
# found nothing bound to the path. No I/O beyond argv/stdout, no MEMCONTINUUM_*
# defaulting, no git -- safe to source unconditionally, same discipline as
# hooks/mc-path-lib.sh (see that file's own header). bash-3.2-safe throughout
# (macOS CI): no `${var,,}`, no `mapfile`, no associative arrays -- `tr`/`sed
# -E`/a plain `for word in $unquoted` split instead.
#
# Two public functions:
#
#   mc_query_source_path PATH CWD STRIP_PREFIXES
#     Picks the form of PATH to tokenize -- a repo-relative path when one is
#     recoverable, the raw PATH otherwise. Tokenizing a raw absolute path
#     buries the filename's own words under machine-path noise ("home
#     someuser dev projectname ...", capped out by mc_query_tokens' own
#     12-token cap before the words that actually matter ever get a look),
#     and a worktree path's raw form spells its `.worktrees/x/...` segment
#     into the query too -- both are exactly the noise the query is
#     supposed to be built FROM THE PATH'S OWN WORDS, not from where it
#     happens to sit on disk. Tries, in order: CWD-relative (mirrors
#     pre-edit-chain.sh's own first candidate), then each colon-separated
#     STRIP_PREFIXES entry in turn (mirrors its MEMCONTINUUM_STRIP_PREFIX
#     candidates) -- the FIRST one that actually strips something wins;
#     falls back to PATH unchanged when none apply (STRIP_PREFIXES empty,
#     CWD empty/not a real ancestor, or PATH simply isn't under any of
#     them). Callers pass the WORKTREE-REMAPPED path here when one exists
#     (pre-edit-chain.sh's own WT_REMAPPED, already `<configured-root>/
#     <relative>` -- one of STRIP_PREFIXES strips it straight down to
#     <relative>), never the worktree's own raw path.
#
#   mc_query_tokens PATH
#     The query-builder proper. Prints the resulting tokens space-joined
#     on stdout (empty string, never an error, when nothing survives the
#     filters -- callers check for that themselves via `[ -z "$q" ]`, same
#     "print nothing" convention `mc_remap_worktree_path` etc. already use
#     for "not applicable"). Stated limits, in the order applied:
#       1. extension stripped from the FINAL path component only (a dot in
#          a directory name never truncates the path) -- `${base%.*}`.
#       2. split into words on `/ _ - .` (directories and the stem both)
#          AND on a camelCase boundary (a lowercase/digit letter directly
#          followed by an uppercase one).
#       3. lowercased.
#       4. any token shorter than 3 characters dropped.
#       5. any token in the fixed generic-stem list dropped (see
#          MC_QUERY_GENERIC_STEMS below) -- these name no project-specific
#          concept, they just describe "this is code".
#       6. deduped, first occurrence wins (path order preserved).
#       7. capped at 12 tokens.
#     No relevance floor, no ranking here -- this only decides WHICH words
#     reach the search call at all; how those words rank once they get
#     there is memidx.py search's own job (deliberately unchanged by this
#     feature -- see docs/DESIGN.md's search-fallback ruling for why).
#
#     Stated limit (MINOR fix-round item, not a bug to fix here): the
#     lowercasing step (`tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`) and the length/split
#     rules above are ASCII-only. A path whose meaningful words are
#     non-ASCII (Cyrillic, CJK, accented Latin, etc.) is not lowercased,
#     not camelCase-split, and its "length" is a BYTE count under `${#word}`
#     in a non-UTF-8 locale (bash 3.2/macOS default `C`/`POSIX` locale
#     included) -- a short multi-byte word can be dropped as "too short"
#     or kept as an oversized byte-run depending on the runtime locale.
#     This channel degrades to "no query" or a partial/garbled one on such
#     a path rather than crashing; full Unicode-aware tokenization is out
#     of scope for this feature (see docs/INTERNALS.md's own note).
#
# mc_now_ms -- millisecond-epoch timestamp, bash-3.2-safe (no
# $EPOCHREALTIME, added in bash 5.0). `date +%s%3N` (GNU coreutils) prints
# 3 zero-padded fractional digits; BSD/macOS `date` has no `%N` at all and
# prints the literal characters `3N` back -- probed ONCE per process via
# MC_QUERY_MS_MODE (empty until the first call) rather than re-probing on
# every timing call a hook makes. The probe result is a plain digit
# string check (`case ... in *[!0-9]*)`), not a hardcoded GNU-vs-BSD
# uname branch, so it also degrades correctly on any OTHER date build
# with partial/no %N support. Falls back to a python one-liner
# (time.time()) when `date` itself can't do it -- always available here
# (every caller already requires python for the search subprocess itself).

# MC_QUERY_GENERIC_STEMS -- exact list per TOP-0133 L1's own spec: words that
# describe "this is code" rather than naming a project-specific concept.
# Space-separated (matches the split-word loop's own `for word in $list`
# idiom used throughout hooks/*.sh -- see hooks/newfile-nudge.sh's
# _ext_matches for the same unquoted-on-purpose pattern), checked via a
# padded `case " $list " in *" $word "*)` substring test so no per-word
# array/loop is needed to answer "is $word in this list".
