# PreToolUse hook: before an Edit/Write touches a file, look up whether any
# decision-chain topic references it (memidx.py for-path) and, if so, inject
# the compressed chain view(s) as additionalContext.
#
# Delivery point (measured, both Claude Code and Codex 0.154.0, TOP-0131
# L2): "before an Edit/Write touches a file" above is about when THIS SCRIPT
# runs, not when the model sees additionalContext. A PreToolUse hook matches
# on tool_input, which exists only once the model has already emitted the
# Edit/Write call with its final old_string/new_string -- so no PreToolUse
# hook on either runtime can shape the content of the edit that triggered
# it. What this script's output CAN still do: run before that edit reaches
# disk, and arrive with that same tool call's result in the same turn --
# governing the agent's next move, not the one that triggered the lookup.
#
# Contract (docs/DESIGN.md SS3.1, SS8):
#   - reads the PreToolUse JSON payload on stdin, extracts tool_input.file_path
#   - no match / any failure  -> exit 0, no stdout (never blocks the edit)
#   - match                   -> one JSON object on stdout:
#         {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse",
#                                  "additionalContext":"..."}}
#   - runs under hooks/mc-watchdog.sh's own budget (see "Watchdog guard"
#     below): a bounded run finishes in well under a second on measurement;
#     a run past the inner budget still exits 0, still logs a named
#     outcome, and still emits a minimal additionalContext stating the
#     retrieval timed out rather than staying silent. Every run appends one
#     timing (or watchdog-kill) line to $MEMCONTINUUM_HOME/hook.log.
#   - hard-clears PYTHONPATH itself (the hook environment trap, DECISION SS8):
#     PreToolUse hooks spawn shells that re-source .bashrc, which re-exports a
#     Windows-site-packages PYTHONPATH that breaks the venv's own packages.
#
# The worktree gap (docs/internal/SESSION-HANDOFF-releases-0.3-to-0.6.md
# SS"0.2.0 final" item 1): once every candidate below (raw path, cwd-
# relative, STRIP_PREFIX forms) has failed for FILE_PATH itself,
# mc_remap_worktree_path (hooks/mc-path-lib.sh) is tried: if FILE_PATH
# sits inside a `git worktree` whose MAIN checkout is one of the roots
# MEMCONTINUUM_STRIP_PREFIX names, it is remapped to its main-checkout-
# equivalent path and fed back through the SAME candidate machinery -- never
# onto an unwired repo's records, and never by indexing the worktree's own
# content. Two outcomes name the ways this can still fail visibly instead of
# collapsing into a plain `no-match`: `worktree-unwired` (confirmed to be a
# worktree, but its main repo isn't a configured root) and
# `worktree-unresolved` (git itself could not settle the question).
#
# This closes the gap in THIS SCRIPT's own logic; it cannot make the harness
# LAUNCH the script for a file outside every "if" glob repo-init.sh renders
# (templates/code-root-filter-pair.json.tmpl scopes each invocation's "if"
# to one literal code-root path) -- a worktree checked out as a SIBLING of
# the wired root never reaches this script at all under current wiring, so
# it gets NO retrieval here (ledger-post-edit.sh, which has no such filter,
# still ledgers it -- see that hook's own header). One checked out INSIDE
# the wired root (e.g. `<root>/.worktrees/x`) DOES reach this script, and
# gets full retrieval -- round 1 of this fix claimed this case was "closed
# end-to-end" while its own callers still silently skipped the remap for
# ANY FILE_PATH already physically under a configured root (Grok's round-2
# BLOCKER finding): the in-root worktree case is what that round-2 fix
# actually closes; round 1 only wired the machinery for it. A project that
# wants retrieval for its own worktrees should therefore keep them INSIDE
# the code root (e.g. `<root>/.worktrees/`, gitignored by that project) --
# a sibling worktree stays ledger-only until the settings-rendering
# follow-up (see this task's own report) widens the "if" glob itself.
#
# Env:
#   MEMCONTINUUM_ROOT     store markdown root; used to derive a default
#                    project name ($(basename "$MEMCONTINUUM_ROOT")) when
#                    MEMCONTINUUM_PROJECT is unset. Also passed to `for-path`
#                    as `--root` (final-fix-wave item 2 -- `for-path` gained
#                    an optional --root so it can see the "stale" state
#                    instead of silently answering "current" off a store
#                    edited since the last reindex) whenever it's set; when
#                    unset, `for-path` is still called, just rootless
#                    (exactly its old behavior -- never "stale"). See
#                    "engine request" below for the still-open suffix-match
#                    ask, unrelated to this.
#   MEMCONTINUUM_PROJECT  project namespace passed to memidx.py --project.
#                    Defaults to $(basename "$MEMCONTINUUM_ROOT"), else "default"
#                    (memidx.py's own DEFAULT_PROJECT). The literal default
#                    the concrete project name belongs in project wiring, never here.
#   MEMCONTINUUM_HOME     passed through to memidx.py unchanged (it resolves its
#                    own index db path from this; see memidx.py --help).
#                    Also where this script's own hook.log lives. Defaults to
#                    ~/.memcontinuum, matching memidx.py's own default.
#   MEMCONTINUUM_PYTHON   absolute path to the venv python. Falls back to
#                    $MEMCONTINUUM_HOME/config.sh (if it sets MEMCONTINUUM_PYTHON),
#                    then <engine>/.venv/bin/python (scripts/repo-init.sh
#                    --bootstrap-venv) when unset.
#   MEMCONTINUUM_STRIP_PREFIX
#                    optional colon-separated list of absolute path prefixes
#                    to strip from tool_input.file_path when trying to match
#                    it against a topic's (repo-relative) code_refs. A real
#                    PreToolUse payload's file_path is always absolute while
#                    code_refs are written relative to a project checkout, so
#                    without this (or a matching cwd) nothing ever matches.
#                    Project-specific values belong in project wiring.
#
# Engine request (not applied here -- memidx.py is not modified by this
# change; recording it per DECISION's rule instead):
#   `for-path` matches a queried path against code_refs by exact/prefix/glob
#   only (memidx.py:code_ref_matches) -- there is no suffix match, so an
#   absolute file_path never matches a repo-relative code_ref on its own.
#   Consider either a `--root`/`--strip-prefix` option on `for-path` itself,
#   or a documented suffix-match mode, so callers don't need this multi-candidate
#   workaround.

# command line on three live stores -- the engine's own, plus two other
# real, live projects, one of them hosted entirely on a slow drvfs
# (/mnt/c) mount, code root and store both -- BEFORE this value was

# command line: 0.198s / 0.206s overall, max 0.206s -- see this task's
# own report for the full per-store table.
# That leaves roughly 10x headroom under the unmodified default budget
# (MC_WATCHDOG_BUDGET unset here -- the five-write-side-hooks 2s default,
# not sessionend-stamp.sh's tighter 1.2s: one for-path call per candidate,
# and a miss walks every candidate, so the fuller budget still covers
# that multi-candidate worst case), so 2s is confirmed by measurement,
# not assumed.
#
# Fix-round measurement update (search fallback, TOP-0133 L1): a genuine
# MISS now also runs `memidx.py search --hydrate` on the same budget --
# measured end to end (hook launch through the search subprocess's own
# rc) at 0.91-0.96s for hybrid mode (its RRF fusion pays for two ranking
# passes plus one embedding-model load/query per run; fts mode alone
# measured well under 0.1s in the same runs, vector mode close to
# hybrid's own cost). Still comfortably inside the 2s budget, but with
# far less headroom than the matched-branch measurement above -- a store
# on a slow drvfs mount (SQLite WAL locking is unreliable there; see this
# repo's own Windows/WSL environment notes) is the candidate case worth
# watching, and MEMCONTINUUM_FALLBACK_MODE=fts (docs/INTERNALS.md) is the
# per-installation escape hatch for it. The shipped default stays hybrid
# either way -- this is a per-installation override, not a default change;
# ship on the engine's own default, let real queries decide whether that
# should move. Sourcing this also resolves MEMCONTINUUM_HOME and MC_GUARD_PY

    # concept entry itself is never counted -- it isn't a topic). Ids are
    # collected into a SET, not just summed, so a topic that is both a
    # direct match and a governor of a matched concept (or governs two
    # matched concepts at once) is counted once in the header, matching
    # the header's own wording ("N topic(s) REFERENCE this file" -- a
    # count of distinct topics, not of chain renderings). chain_text
    # itself is unaffected by this and keeps rendering that topic's chain
    # once per role (for_path_chain_lines has no dedup of its own) -- the
    # header and the body are allowed to disagree in that one direction.
    # Round 5 had instead replicated the
    # OLD `grep -c '"id":'` behavior verbatim, quirk included: `grep -c`
    # counts matching LINES, not occurrences, and the old RESULTS_ONLY (a
    # plain `json.dumps`, no `indent=`) was always exactly one line -- so
    # the header always said "1 topic(s)" no matter how many topics or
    # concepts actually matched. That quirk is what this round fixes: a
    # two-topic match now reports "2", not "1" (tests/test_hooks.py's

    # byte-for-byte comparison against the frozen pre-round-5 script,

# Round 7 fix (Codex MAJOR): this stream is field-delimited by chr(0) and

# CURRENT read -- not just the one this loop appends after each field. A
# record whose decoded text embeds a real NUL (e.g. YAML "before\0after"
# in a ruling/rationale/owner_boundary string -- json.dumps escapes it as
# six ASCII characters, backslash-u-0-0-0-0, in transit, and json.load
# decodes that back to an actual NUL byte here) used to truncate that
# read call current field AND silently discard every field still queued
# behind it in the SAME stream (here chain_text is last, so nothing
# downstream was lost, but the same one-shared-stream risk applies to any
# future field added after it) -- the topic_count computed above from the
# untruncated results still reported the full count, while
# additionalContext itself went missing everything past the embedded
# NUL. The pre-round-5 transport (three separate command substitutions,
# one value per call) never hit this: plain command substitution in bash
# silently DROPS embedded NUL bytes from captured output, it does not
# truncate the surrounding text. Matching that behavior -- not somehow
# delivering a real NUL through a NUL-delimited protocol -- is the fix:
# strip NULs from each field before it enters the shared stream, so a
# NUL can never be mistaken for the chr(0) delimiter, and no text past
# it is ever lost.
#
# eval-topic-logging is exactly the "future field added after it" this
# comment warned about -- topics_field is inserted here, BEFORE chain_text,
# never after, so chain_text keeps the guarantee above (it is still the
# LAST field in the stream, so nothing can ever queue behind IT to be lost
# the way this comment describes). Same NUL-stripping treatment as every
# other field, for the same reason.

# THIS block never sources hooks/memlib.sh (the mkdir/config.sh/MC_PY cost
# that would add on every already-a-miss lookup is exactly what this
# hook's own header explains it exists to avoid) -- so the "configured
# code roots" it can check a remap against are read from
# MEMCONTINUUM_STRIP_PREFIX instead of mc_code_roots. MINOR fix-round
# correction: this used to say the SCRIPT never sources memlib.sh at all
# -- no longer true since the search fallback (TOP-0133 L1) added its own
# session-state write further down, which lazily sources memlib.sh ONLY
# on that already-rare branch (a genuine miss AND at least one search
# hit) -- see that branch's own comment. This worktree-gap block, reached
# on every miss regardless of what the fallback later does, still pays
# nothing extra. repo-init.sh
# renders exactly ONE STRIP_PREFIX entry per invocation (= the single code
# root that invocation's settings.json "if" filter is already scoped to,
# templates/code-root-filter-pair.json.tmpl), so this is a faithful reading
# of "the configured roots this invocation knows about", not a
# looser/lossier stand-in for mc_code_roots. A hand-wired STRIP_PREFIX that
# is not really a repo root can never produce a false remap either way --
# mc_remap_worktree_path's own match test is exact common-dir identity,
# never a prefix/substring test (see its header in hooks/mc-path-lib.sh)
# -- it would just make the remap silently not fire.
#
# Round 2 fix (Grok BLOCKER): a FILE_PATH already physically under one of
# these roots used to skip this whole block outright -- wrong for a
# worktree checked out INSIDE the root (e.g. `<root>/.worktrees/feat/`),
# the ONLY worktree location the settings-level "if" glob
# (templates/code-root-filter-pair.json.tmpl) ever lets THIS SCRIPT be
# invoked for at all (a sibling worktree's Edit never matches that glob,
# so it never reaches this script -- see this file's own header). Fixed:
# still zero extra `git` calls for the ordinary in-root case (no nested
# worktree at all -- by far the common shape of an in-root miss), via
# mc_nested_worktree_gitfile's bash-only ancestor walk; mc_remap_worktree_path's
# own calls -- one identity call for FILE_PATH itself, plus one more per
# configured root while it searches for a match -- are paid only when that
# walk actually finds a nested `.git` FILE between FILE_PATH and the
# matching root.

# as memidx.py rendered it -- and for_path_chain_lines can end in a
# newline when its LAST line is a concept row whose owner_boundary came
# from a YAML `|` block scalar (block-scalar clipping keeps exactly one
# trailing newline). Left alone, that trailing newline plus the "\n\n"
# join separator below produces an extra blank line before
# CITATION_REMINDER in additionalContext, diverging from the frozen
# pre-round-5 oracle byte-for-byte. Strip every trailing newline here, at
# the hook boundary, to restore the old `$(...)` parity -- a `case`/`%`
# loop, not `${var: -1}` or any bash-4-only trick, so this stays bash
# 3.2-safe; never touches a newline embedded INSIDE the text.
