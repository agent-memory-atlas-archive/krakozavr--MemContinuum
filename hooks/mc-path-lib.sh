#
# Symlink-safe containment: does FILE_PATH's real location sit under ROOT's
# real location? Originally hooks/newfile-nudge.sh's own fix (2026-08-31
# review) for its PreToolUse containment check; factored out (first into
# hooks/memlib.sh, then here) so hooks/ledger-post-edit.sh shares the SAME
# implementation instead of keeping the plain lexical prefix match that fix
# already replaced in newfile-nudge.sh -- one implementation, both hooks
# call it.
#
# A plain lexical `case "$FILE_PATH" in "$ROOT"/*` prefix match is fooled
# both by a literal `/../` traversal segment (textually under ROOT while
# actually resolving to a sibling of it) and by a symlinked ancestor
# directory (every path segment textually under ROOT, but the real
# directory it names lives elsewhere). Fixed bash-3.2-safe, no external
# binaries beyond what every caller here already uses:
#   1. reject any literal `/../` traversal segment (or a leading `../`, or
#      a bare `..`) outright, purely as a string -- a syntactic red flag
#      regardless of what it would resolve to.
#   2. canonicalize ROOT and the nearest EXISTING ancestor directory of
#      FILE_PATH (walking up via dirname -- handles both a FILE_PATH that
#      already exists, ledger-post-edit.sh's usual case, and one that does
#      not yet, newfile-nudge.sh's usual case) via `cd ... && pwd -P`,
#      which resolves symlinks, and require that ancestor to sit under the
#      canonicalized root -- compared as a LITERAL string (see below), not
#      as a case/glob pattern.
#
# Returns WHY, not just yes/no -- newfile-nudge.sh's outcome= vocabulary
# distinguishes these in hook.log (memidx.py stats greps it); a caller
# that only needs yes/no (ledger-post-edit.sh) collapses every nonzero
# into its own single out-of-scope outcome.

# mc_nested_worktree_gitfile FILE_PATH ROOT
#
# Round 2 BLOCKER fix (Grok): both callers used to skip
# mc_remap_worktree_path entirely whenever `mc_path_under_root FILE_PATH
# ROOT` already returned 0 -- reasoning that a file physically under a
# configured root can never need remapping. False for a `git worktree add`
# checkout made INSIDE the root itself (e.g. `<root>/.worktrees/feat/`):
# FILE_PATH is genuinely under ROOT by that plain containment test, but the
# worktree is a SEPARATE git checkout from ROOT's own -- its tracked-file
# paths are relative to the WORKTREE's own toplevel, not ROOT's, so the
# raw/cwd-relative/STRIP_PREFIX candidates every caller already tries for
# FILE_PATH itself are the wrong relative form and a real decision binds
# to nothing. This function is the caller-side gate that decides whether
# that expensive check (one `git` call, inside mc_remap_worktree_path) is
# worth paying for an in-root FILE_PATH: bash-only, no git, no python --
# does a `.git` FILE (a linked worktree's own marker -- an ordinary
# checkout's `.git` is a DIRECTORY) sit somewhere on FILE_PATH's ancestor
# chain STRICTLY BELOW ROOT's own real location?
#
# Deliberately EXCLUDES ROOT's own `.git` from the check (stops the walk
# the instant it reaches ROOT's real path, never tests ROOT itself): a
# root created via `--separate-git-dir`, or a root that is itself a linked
# worktree of some other checkout (both real layouts this repo supports,
# see mc_remap_worktree_path's own root-loop fix below), has a `.git` FILE
# right AT the root -- an ordinary in-root main-checkout file must still
# pay zero git calls in that layout too, and would not if this function
# tested ROOT's own entry as well.
#
# Returns 0 (nested gitfile found -- pay for the real check) or 1
# (no nested gitfile before reaching ROOT, or ROOT/FILE_PATH don't
# resolve -- ordinary in-root file, skip the remap attempt entirely, zero
# cost beyond this bash-only walk).

# SS"0.2.0 final" item 1): MEMCONTINUUM_CODE_ROOTS/MEMCONTINUUM_STRIP_PREFIX name
# absolute paths fixed at repo-init time. A `git worktree add` checkout of
# a wired repo is a different absolute directory nothing wired -- every
# candidate hooks/pre-edit-chain.sh builds and hooks/ledger-post-edit.sh's
# own root-containment loop both come up empty, indistinguishable from a
# genuine absence. This function maps the EDITED PATH back to its
# main-checkout equivalent so the existing candidate/containment logic can
# be reused unchanged -- it does not itself decide anything about whether a
# decision applies, and it never causes worktree CONTENT to be indexed
# (only a path string is computed here).
#
# ROOTS is a newline-separated list of configured code-root absolute paths
# (mc_code_roots' own output shape for ledger-post-edit.sh; the caller
# builds it from MEMCONTINUUM_STRIP_PREFIX -- stripped of a trailing slash --
# for pre-edit-chain.sh, which deliberately does not source memlib.sh/
# mc_code_roots to avoid that file's mkdir/config.sh cost on every
# already-a-miss lookup; repo-init.sh renders exactly one STRIP_PREFIX
# entry, = the one code root that invocation is scoped to, per
# CODE_ROOT_FILTERS in templates/code-root-filter-pair.json.tmpl -- a
# hand-wired STRIP_PREFIX that happens not to equal any real repo root
# only ever makes this root's OWN common-dir resolution fail below, i.e.
# the remap silently doesn't fire for that root; it can never produce a
# FALSE match, since the match test is exact common-dir identity, never a
# prefix/substring test.
#
# Caller contract (both hooks, round 2 revision -- Grok BLOCKER): call
# this ONLY after every existing candidate/containment check has already
# failed for FILE_PATH itself -- see each hook's own comment at its call
# site for why. A file already inside a configured root does NOT skip
# this call any more (round 1's "never reaches here" was the bug Grok
# found: it silently dropped exactly the in-root worktree case, the ONLY
# worktree location the settings-level PreToolUse matcher can ever
# invoke pre-edit-chain.sh for at all) -- callers instead gate on the
# cheap, bash-only mc_nested_worktree_gitfile FILE_PATH ROOT first for a
# FILE_PATH already under that ROOT: a `.git` FILE strictly below ROOT
# means a real nested linked worktree, worth paying this function's `git`
# call for; no such gitfile means an ordinary in-root file, and callers
# skip this call entirely, so the ordinary common case still pays zero
# extra `git` calls. A FILE_PATH NOT already under any configured root
# still calls this unconditionally, same as round 1.
#
# Detection, in order (cheapest guard first, at least one `git` process
# once a `.git` entry is confirmed to exist, one more per configured ROOT
# on the miss branch below):
#   1. FILE_PATH must be absolute and free of a literal `..` traversal
#      segment (same syntactic guard as mc_path_under_root) -- anything
#      else: not applicable, return 3, no git call.
#   2. Walk FILE_PATH up to its nearest EXISTING ancestor directory (same
#      walk as mc_path_under_root -- covers a Write of a file that does not
#      exist yet), then walk THAT up to `/` doing a bare `[ -e "$d/.git" ]`
#      check (no subprocess -- same "rule out no .git entry at all"
#      precedent hooks/ledger-post-edit.sh's own shell-diff branch already
#      uses for exactly this reason). No `.git` anywhere on the chain: this
#      ancestor is not in any git checkout at all -- not applicable, return
#      3, no git call. This is what keeps an ordinary /tmp or /mnt file (by
#      far the common shape of a genuine miss) from ever spawning git.
#   3. A `.git` entry exists somewhere above: exactly ONE `git -C <ancestor>
#      rev-parse --git-common-dir --show-toplevel` call. Either line
#      missing, or either resolves-to-absolute step below fails: git itself
#      could not settle the question -- return 2 (worktree-unresolved; the
#      caller logs a NAMED outcome instead of a silent no-match/out-of-
#      scope, per the "say something when it cannot resolve" floor -- this
#      also covers a repo whose `.git` was created via `--separate-git-dir`
#      pointing somewhere this resolution can't follow, deliberately: out
#      of scope, treated the same as "can't tell").
#   4. --git-common-dir and --show-toplevel are each resolved to an
#      absolute, symlink-safe path via `cd ... && pwd -P` (the same
#      resolution mc_path_under_root already uses for ROOT/ancestor above;
#      --git-common-dir can print a RELATIVE path -- relative to the `-C`
#      directory -- on git versions this repo doesn't pin a floor above,
#      hence the two-step `cd ancestor && cd common_raw`).
#   5. Resolved common-dir == resolved-toplevel + "/.git" (a plain STRING
#      comparison, not a second `cd` into it -- a linked worktree's own
#      `.git` is a FILE, not a directory, so relying on a `cd` failing
#      there would be an accident of the worktree case, not a real check):
#      this ancestor is an ORDINARY checkout, not a linked worktree at all
#      (editing a file that happens to live under some other, unconfigured
#      repo's own main checkout) -- not applicable, return 3. This is what
#      keeps the common "genuinely outside every configured root, and not
#      a worktree either" miss from ever being renamed away from its
#      today's plain outcome.
#   6. Otherwise this genuinely IS a linked worktree. Compute FILE_PATH's
#      physical location (ancestor_real + whatever of FILE_PATH sat past
#      the ancestor, same reconstruction mc_path_under_root's callers rely
#      on for a not-yet-existing file) and its path relative to the
#      worktree's own toplevel -- code_refs are written relative to a
#      checkout root and a worktree mirrors its main checkout's tracked
#      layout exactly, so that relative form is exactly what a main-
#      checkout edit of the same file would also be relative to.
#   7. For each ROOT: resolve ROOT's OWN common-dir via `git -C "$ROOT"
#      rev-parse --git-common-dir` (round 2 fix, Grok + Codex MAJOR --
#      `cd "$ROOT/.git"` assumed ROOT's `.git` is a directory, which is
#      false when ROOT is itself a linked worktree or a
#      `--separate-git-dir` checkout; asking git for ROOT's identity
#      instead of assuming a layout fixes both) and compare it to
#      FILE_PATH's already-resolved common-dir, by exact string identity
#      first and `-ef` filesystem identity as a fallback (never a
#      prefix/glob test -- see the STRIP_PREFIX note above for why this
#      can only fail closed). First match: print "$ROOT/$relative" and
#      return 0. No ROOT matches at all: this worktree's main repo was
#      never wired as a code root here -- return 1 (worktree-unwired) --
#      the correctness condition the caller must not skip (docs/internal
#      handoff item 1): remapping onto an UNWIRED repo's records would be
#      a false hit against a decision that has nothing to do with it.
#
# Returns (never writes anything on any nonzero return):
#   0  remapped -- stdout carries the one-line main-checkout-equivalent
#      absolute path
#   1  worktree-unwired  -- confirmed a linked worktree; no ROOT matched
#   2  worktree-unresolved -- confirmed (or suspected, via a `.git` entry)
#      to be repo-related but git itself failed or a resolution step did
#   3  not applicable -- FILE_PATH is malformed/relative, no `.git` entry
#      exists on its ancestor chain at all, or this ancestor is an
