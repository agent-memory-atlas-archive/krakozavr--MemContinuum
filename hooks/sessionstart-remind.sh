#                        Silent UNLESS the standing-decisions digest (next

#
#   TOP-0132 L1/L2 (every source): after the per-source work above, always
#                        attempts the standing-decisions digest --
#                        `memidx.py standing --json`'s citation-only
#                        projection of every topic's own `standing:`
#                        pointer list, computed AFTER every state mutation
#                        the branch already makes (init/prune/rotate on
#                        startup; pending consumption on compact) so a
#                        watchdog kill during the digest's own subprocess
#                        calls loses only the digest, never that
#                        bookkeeping. A non-current index (missing,
#                        uninitialized, upgrade-required, stale, OR
#                        quarantined -- `standing` refuses on every one of
#                        these, unlike every other reader here) or an empty
#                        standing set injects nothing, logged
#                        `standing=skipped-<state>` / `standing=empty`.
#                        Otherwise: `startup`/`resume` dedupe by comparing
#                        the digest's hash against `state["standing_hash"]`
#                        inside the SAME locked state-update transform that
#                        sets it (never a separate read-then-write -- see
#                        mc_compute_standing's callers), logging
#                        `standing=dedup` on a match; `clear` and `compact`
#                        ALWAYS inject regardless of any stored hash (the
#                        context is gone either way), logging
#                        `standing=injected links=N bytes=B hash=H`. On
#                        `compact`, the digest is appended AFTER coverage's
#                        (or, failing that, look-back's) own text in the
#                        same additionalContext -- coverage stays first
#                        when it has evidence. Loaded is not applied -- this
#                        raises the odds a standing ruling is honored, it
#                        is not a guarantee.
#
#                        `clear` (INC-0108) is a fresh session, not a
#                        continuation: /clear commonly fires on the SAME
#                        session_id an earlier startup already created state
#                        for (a /clear mid-process, same CLI run), so unlike
#                        resume it must DISCARD most of whatever state is
#                        already on disk for this session_id before the
#                        setdefault init below runs -- a leftover turn-count/
#                        pending/look-back baseline from before the clear
#                        would misfire the coverage/look-back nudges against
#                        turns the cleared context no longer has, and a stale
#                        SessionEnd `ended_at` stamp has no business
#                        surviving into a session that is still running. ONE
#                        field survives the discard: `ledger` (the edited-
#                        but-not-yet-mapped-to-a-decision file list) is
#                        carried over as-is -- userprompt-remind.sh's
#                        coverage check (`memidx.py unmapped`) classifies
#                        candidates *only* from `state["ledger"]`, never from
#                        a tree walk, so wiping it would make any file edited
#                        before the clear that is still genuinely unmapped
#                        invisible to the coverage nudge for the rest of the
#                        session, unless it happens to be touched again post-
#                        clear -- silent evidence loss of exactly the kind
#                        this project treats as zero-tolerance. The
#                        discard-plus-carry-ledger happens inside the same
#                        locked mc_update_state_json transform (state
#                        rebuilt to just {"ledger": ...} at the top, only for
#                        clear) so there is no separate unlocked delete step
#                        and no window where a concurrent read sees a half-
#                        reset file.
#   compact           -- read state.pending (written by precompact-persist.sh
#                         right before compaction), and if it holds anything,
#                         inject it ONCE via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext
#                         (SessionStart's additionalContext is the first thing
#                         the model sees post-compaction). Consumes (clears)
#                         pending afterward so a later resume-after-compact
#                         doesn't re-inject the same evidence. If coverage has
#                         no evidence AND pending's snapshotted
#                         (user_turn_count - last_growth_turn) >= 3, injects
#                         the look-back compact twin instead (WRITE-HOOKS-
#                         CONSENSUS.md addendum 2026-08-30) -- coverage always
#                         wins when it has evidence; the twin ignores the
#                         cooldown entirely (one-shot loss point), and stamps
#                         last_inject_turn/last_inject_ts on firing so the
#                         very next per-turn hook call doesn't immediately
#                         re-fire on the same stretch.

# hooks/userprompt-remind.sh's test_outer_deadline_covers_memlib_sourcing

# (mc-watchdog.sh's MC_WATCHDOG_LAUNCHER_PY) starts this same script as a

# Fix-round MAJOR (both reviewers, Opus measured 0.95-1.18s on drvfs with
# two links against the 2s watchdog): a prior version called `memidx.py
# standing` TWICE -- once --json for the structured fields, once plain for
# the exact text -- each a full module import (yaml, chunkers). Two calls
# cost roughly double, AND a store commit landing between them could make
# the logged hash disagree with the injected text (the very thing the
# dedupe/log line exists to describe accurately). ONE call now: the same
# python step that already parses the JSON for kind/links/hash/bytes also
# reconstructs the plain text from "lines" and writes it to a second
# tmpfile -- HEADER below is a literal copy of memidx.py's own
# STANDING_HEADER constant, not re-derived (there is no cheap way to ask a
# python module for one constant without importing the whole module,
# which is the exact cost this fix removes); the two ship in the same
# commit/repo, so they can never drift version-to-version by accident --
# grep STANDING_HEADER in memidx.py before ever changing either.
# Bash 3.2: no associative arrays, no `local -n`; globals by convention
# (this file is a leaf script, never sourced elsewhere).
# STANDING_IDS_CSV (TOP-0133 L2, Addendum B): comma-joined, deduped TOPIC
# ids (never link ids) behind every pointer this call's own digest would
# deliver -- so the prompt-query channel can treat "already surfaced by
# the standing digest" the same as "already surfaced by a search
# fallback" and never re-guess a topic the model already has in context.
# Derived from `standing --json`'s own "lines" (never a second query):
# each line is `standing_line`'s own rendering, `f"{topic_id} {link_id}
# (...): ..."`, so the FIRST whitespace-delimited token of a line is
# always that pointer's topic id -- see memidx.py's standing_line before
