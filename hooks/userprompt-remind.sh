# UserPromptSubmit hook: the live, mid-session reminder point. Injects a
# "Coverage signal" fact block via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext when
# ALL of these hold (docs/DESIGN.md rulings A/C):
#
#   - agent_id/agent_type are NOT set (never inside a subagent, and never a
#     session run under `--agent`) -- fix-round 2026-08-31: this hook used to
#     also require source=="user", but a real UserPromptSubmit payload NEVER
#     carries a `source` field at all (that field belongs to SessionStart's
#     startup/resume/clear/compact/fork; the two events were confused --
#     docs: code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks). Empirically confirmed: 30/30 real
#     invocations in one session died as outcome=non-user-source. The gate
#     is gone; agent_id/agent_type (documented as present only under
#     `--agent` or inside a subagent) is the real "never in a subagent, never
#     the main thread run as a persona" signal.
#   - the ledger's evidence fingerprint GREW since the last injection --
#     defined as: the set of (path, content_sha256) pairs currently in the
#     ledger contains at least one pair that was not in the pair-set
#     captured at the last injection. A path re-edited with different
#     content counts as growth; an unchanged ledger does not.
#   - cooldown has elapsed: >= 3 user turns OR >= 15 minutes since the last
#     injection (whichever comes first -- Grok's OR wording)
#
# When coverage does NOT inject this turn (either it was never a candidate,
# or it was but classification found no evidence), this hook falls through
# to the T-thin look-back reminder instead (docs/DESIGN.md
# addendum 2026-08-30, "the look-back reminder"): fire when the conversation
# has advanced but the edit ledger has not --
#
#   since_turn = user_turn_count - max(last_inject_turn, last_growth_turn)
#   since_time = now - max(last_inject_ts, last_growth_ts)
#   thin = (since_turn >= 5) OR (since_time >= 1200)
#
# -- with NO per-session cap (owner ruling 2026-08-30 14:02: a cap means a
# decision made after the last permitted nudge is never asked about; the
# thin condition itself already prevents wallpaper during active building).
# `lookback_count` is tracked in state and logged on every look-back fire --
# it never gates eligibility. Coverage always wins: this hook never emits
# two blocks in the same turn. Every look-back write (per-turn here, and
# the SessionStart(compact) twin) also stamps last_inject_time -- coverage's
# own cooldown clock -- so a coverage candidate on the very next turn can't
# read a stale/zero last_inject_time and fire right through the cooldown
# that's supposed to follow a look-back (dual-gate review finding 4).
#
# The commit nudge (TOP-0122 L1 rule 2a; docs/INTERNALS.md "The commit
# nudge"): the moved-HEAD check itself runs on EVERY prompt, independent of
# coverage's own candidacy (ledger-growth/cooldown) gate -- only the actual
# nudge work (the `unmapped` call, the commit-message read, the fact line)
# is skipped on a turn that is neither a coverage candidate nor has any
# root moved. For each configured code root whose HEAD differs from
# state's last_seen_heads since the last prompt, reads that commit's own
# message (one `git log -1`, never the diff, never the prompt) and, when
# it names no decision id and this turn's own `unmapped` call already
# finds a file edited under that root during the session with no topic,
# adds one fact line and logs `outcome=commit-nudge` once per commit
# (state's `nudged_commits`). On a coverage-candidate turn the fact line
# joins coverage's own additionalContext block; on a turn that is not a
# candidate but a root moved, it is the WHOLE additionalContext (no
# coverage content), the turn's own outcome is `nudge-only`, and
# coverage's own cooldown/delivery bookkeeping is left untouched. It never
# gets a second turn, a second cooldown of its own, or a second `unmapped`
# call.
#
# This hook NEVER reads transcript_path, user_input, prompt, or
# last_assistant_message from the payload (ruling B; the addendum extends
# the not-read invariant to `prompt`, the alternate payload key Claude Code
# may use for the same field) -- only session_id, agent_id, agent_type, and
# prompt_id. prompt_id itself is never extracted, stored, or logged: only
# sha256(prompt_id)[:16] ever exists past the one extraction call (dual-gate
# review finding 2), stored as `last_prompt_hash`, for dedupe only. A
# duplicate delivery (the same prompt_id redelivered) suppresses the WHOLE
# hook for that turn -- no turn advance, no coverage candidacy, no
# look-back eligibility, no injection of any kind -- UNLESS `delivery_open`
# is still true (re-gate finding, HIGH, Codex+Grok: the outer-timeout
# swallow case, where phase 1 committed this hash+turn but the invocation
# was killed before it ever produced stdout). In that case the redelivery
# is a RETRY, not a duplicate: it runs the normal decision path again, but
# without a second turn advance or hash re-stamp. Once a delivery actually
# completes (real stdout, or a genuinely-finished silent turn), delivery_open
# closes and any further same-hash redelivery goes back to full suppression.
#
# The raw payload (which may carry real prompt content under user_input/
# prompt) is read ONCE, on stdin, by the single field-extraction call
# (mc_extract_fields, memlib.sh) -- it is NEVER placed in an exported
# environment variable, so no subprocess this hook spawns (dirname/mkdir/
# cat/env/python) ever inherits it (dual-gate review
# finding 1, BLOCKER). Only the extracted scalar fields (session_id,
# agent_id/agent_type presence, a prompt_id fingerprint) and the sorted
# top-level payload KEY NAMES (never values -- the payload-shape capture
# addendum below) ever exist past that call.
#
# Payload-shape capture (Codex fixture request): on this hook's first turn
# with a resolvable session_id and an already-started session (state file
# exists), logs the sorted list of top-level payload KEY NAMES ONLY (never
# values) as `payload_keys=...`, once per session -- BEFORE the
# agent_id/agent_type gate below (fix-round 2026-08-31: the previous
# placement was inside phase 1's locked transform, reached only once every
# earlier gate had already let the turn through; the source=="user" gate
# rejected every real payload before that point, so `payload_keys=` never
# once appeared in hook.log for a real session -- the exact evidence that
# would have shown the contract mismatch was itself gated behind the bug).
# The common-case (already logged this session) path is a plain grep
# against the state file, no subprocess -- only the genuinely-first turn
# pays for the one locked write.
#
# Evidence is computed LIVE here (not read from state.pending, which is only
# populated around a compaction) -- but only once cooldown+growth already
# passed, via one `memidx.py unmapped` call (self-healing) over the ledger's
# code-root paths, so the (comparatively expensive) classification only runs
# on turns that were already going to inject something.
#
# Always exits 0 and prints nothing on any failure (fail-open). This hook
# makes many SEQUENTIAL python calls with no timeout of their own any more
# (macOS port, 2026-08-30): the whole hook re-execs itself under an OUTER
# python watchdog on entry instead (see the guard just below) -- a single 2s
# wall-clock budget for the ENTIRE run, enforced by killing the guarded
# child's whole process group on expiry, so a chain of slow-but-not-hung
# calls summing past budget is bounded exactly the same way a single hung
# call is.
#
# Env: see hooks/memlib.sh.

# Watchdog guard (macOS port, docs/DESIGN.md SS8 port note, 2026-08-30;
# deduped into hooks/mc-watchdog.sh, finding 1, 2026-08-31): this guard
# must be the LITERAL first thing this script does after `set -u` and
# resolving its own location -- in particular, strictly BEFORE sourcing
# memlib.sh (which does its own mkdir -p work). Sourcing mc-watchdog.sh
# itself is safe here: it costs at most one `[ -f ]` stat and sourcing a
# few config.sh assignment lines while resolving MC_GUARD_PY (F6 fix,
# round 4) -- no external process, no shelling out (see its own header),
# unlike memlib.sh, whose own body used to run unbounded on the
# outer, un-timed invocation before this fix -- a slow/hung memlib.sh
# could blow the whole invocation's wall time with no bound at all.
# Sourcing memlib.sh stays strictly AFTER this guard, i.e. only ever
# inside the guarded child, already under the watchdog below (see
# test_outer_deadline_covers_memlib_sourcing).
#
# Re-gate finding (MED, Codex), still true under the port: same reasoning,
# new mechanism. macOS bash 3.2 ships neither `timeout` nor `flock`, so the
# old `timeout 2 bash "$0"` re-exec is replaced with a tiny python launcher
# (mc-watchdog.sh's MC_WATCHDOG_LAUNCHER_PY): it starts this same script as
# a child in its own process group and kills the WHOLE group on a 2s
# wall-clock budget, so an orphaned grandchild (a hung python call several
# layers deep -- the exact failure the old MC_TIMEOUT_FG/--foreground dance
# in memlib.sh existed to prevent, or the launcher itself being killed --
# finding 1's SIGTERM/SIGINT/atexit fix) cannot outlive the deadline
# either. Every python call this script and memlib.sh's helpers make
# therefore needs no timeout of its own any more -- this one watchdog
# bounds the entire run (memlib.sh's MC_TIMEOUT_FG plumbing is gone along
# with every per-call `timeout`). Always exits 0; stdin/stdout/stderr are
# the real, inherited file descriptors (never piped through python), so
# passthrough is unbuffered. The re-exec'd child is started via `$BASH`
# (the invoking shell's own resolved path), never a bare literal `bash`,
# so a harness that overrides which bash interpreter runs this script
# (e.g. the bash-3.2 verification harness, tests/run_bash32.sh) is
# honored all the way down. If MEMCONTINUUM_PYTHON (or the venv fallback)
# does not resolve to an executable, or mc-watchdog.sh failed to source
# (MC_WATCHDOG_LAUNCHER_PY unset), this falls through UNGUARDED instead
# of exec-ing a dead path -- memlib.sh's own "no python resolved"
# detection then fires exactly as it would with no guard at all.

# entirely inside `if CANDIDATE=1`, so once a coverage reminder had already
# fired once (consuming `grew` against last_injected_pairs), a commit with
# no decision id followed by any number of further prompts with no NEW
# ledger growth produced zero commit nudges -- last_seen_heads never even
# advanced, because the moved-HEAD comparison itself never ran. Design R5
# (audit MC-P1-05, TOP-0123 L5): every configured code root, captured ONCE
# (one python spawn via mc_code_roots, memlib.sh) and reused below by BOTH
# the `unmapped` call and the per-root HEAD comparison -- a herestring-fed
# while-read loop (bash 3.2 safe, no array-of-roots to guard against
# `set -u`'s empty-array expansion). `git rev-parse HEAD` per root
# (mc_git_head, no python) is unavoidable (bash 3.2 cannot do a dict
# lookup without one), but the state-file lookup/comparison is ONE
# combined python call covering BOTH code (per-root map) and store
# (unchanged, single root) -- LOW-3/LOW-4 (task-7-review.md): both the
# per-root HEAD loop and this comparison live once in memlib.sh
# (mc_code_heads_from / mc_head_changed). MOVED_ROOTS itself is a CHEAP
# GATE only -- git rev-parse per root plus one python call, no `unmapped`
# invocation yet -- so the overwhelmingly common turn (no root moved, not
