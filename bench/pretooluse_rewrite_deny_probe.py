"""pretooluse_rewrite_deny_probe -- measures two more facts about the real
Claude Code PreToolUse hook contract, on a real non-interactive session,
not from documentation:

  1. Does `hookSpecificOutput.updatedInput` actually rewrite an Edit call
     before it executes, and what exactly can it change (content only,
     file_path, a partial object), and what happens when the rewritten
     input is invalid?
  2. Does `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision: "deny"` actually block
     the call, does the model see the reason text and when, does a retry
     carry the denial's content, and does an always-denying hook hang the
     session?

Companion to bench/pretooluse_ordering_probe.py, whose fixture machinery
this module reuses directly (imported, not copied): `parse_transcript` and
`_default_claude_binary`. Unlike that probe, the hook under test here is
NOT the engine's real hooks/pre-edit-chain.sh -- these two questions are
about the generic Claude Code hook contract, not about MemContinuum's own
hook, so a small scenario-driven stand-in
(bench/pretooluse_probe_hook.py, stdlib-only, behaviour selected by env
vars) is used instead. Everything else about the fixture (disposable HOME,
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, TMPDIR, a project-scoped .claude/settings.json, a
per-run nonce that must never leak into the prompt or the project tree)
follows the same conventions as the ordering probe.

Where the field shapes came from (NOT external docs -- the installed CLI's
own bundled reference text and internal validation-error strings,
extracted with `strings` against the installed binary):

    strings ~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.270 | grep -A3 hookSpecificOutput

  - "`permissionDecision` - \"allow\", \"deny\", or \"ask\" (PreToolUse only)"
  - "`permissionDecisionReason` - Reason for the permission decision (PreToolUse only)"
  - "`updatedInput` - Modified tool input (PreToolUse only)"
  - "Expected {behavior: 'allow', updatedInput?: object} or {behavior: 'deny', message: string}."
    (the internal decision shape hookSpecificOutput is normalised into)
  - "PreToolUse hook for ... returned updatedInput that failed schema
    validation: " / "InputValidationError: permission handler updatedInput
    failed schema for " (updatedInput is validated against the TOOL's own
    input schema, e.g. Edit's file_path/old_string/new_string)
  - "...: updatedInput is missing or empty, falling back to original tool
    input" (an orphaned-permission fallback path, not directly the
    PreToolUse merge path -- noted for context, not relied on)

Claude Code version measured throughout: 2.1.270 (`claude --version`).
No `--max-turns` CLI flag exists in this build (checked via `claude
--help`); the hang guard for the always-deny scenario is `--max-budget-usd`
plus this harness's own subprocess timeout, exactly like the ordering
probe's existing safety net.

D3 and D4 extend the same D1/D1B family to answer two follow-up questions
about what a pre-edit hook can actually enforce, once denial itself and
dictated-nonce refusal were established:
  - D3: does a denial naming an ORDINARY, PLAUSIBLE, non-nonce value --
    grounded in a real sibling file the model can Read and verify -- get
    treated differently on retry than D1/D1B's nonce-shaped dictated
    values were? Same single-denial-then-allow shape as D1B; only the
    value's shape and grounding change.
  - D4: does a denial that states the rule, its authority, and where it
    was decided, WITH NO REPLACEMENT VALUE NAMED, let the model converge
    on compliant content by its own judgement? Evaluated fresh on every
    call (not just call 1); uses LATITUDE_PROMPT instead of PROMPT since
    the default prompt dictates a literal that would conflict with any
    no-literals rule.

Usage (one real session per scenario; each builds and tears down its own
/tmp fixture):
    PYTHONPATH= PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 <python> \
        bench/pretooluse_rewrite_deny_probe.py --scenario R1
    ... --scenario {R1,R2,R3,R4,D1,D1B,D2,D3,D3L,D4,all}

D3L is a control for D3: identical denial and grounding, but run under
LATITUDE_PROMPT (D4's prompt) instead of the default PROMPT, to separate
"the dictated value's shape" from "the value contradicts what the user
explicitly instructed" as the explanation for D3's split outcome.
