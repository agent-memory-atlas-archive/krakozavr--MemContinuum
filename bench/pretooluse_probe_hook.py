"""pretooluse_probe_hook -- a disposable, scenario-driven PreToolUse hook
used only by bench/pretooluse_rewrite_deny_probe.py. NOT part of the real
MemContinuum hook chain (hooks/pre-edit-chain.sh is that); this is a
minimal, stdlib-only stand-in whose entire behaviour is selected by
environment variables so one script covers every scenario the probe needs
(rewrite content, rewrite file_path, rewrite with an invalid old_string,
rewrite with a partial object, deny-then-allow, always-deny, deny naming an
ordinary plausible value, deny naming no value at all).

Contract shape it emits (`hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`,
`.permissionDecisionReason`, `.updatedInput`) was established from the
installed Claude Code CLI's own bundled reference text and internal
validation-error strings (binary at
~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.270, version 2.1.270; extracted via
`strings` -- see bench/pretooluse_rewrite_deny_probe.py's module docstring
for the exact citations), not from external docs.

Every invocation is logged to $PROBE_LOG (one JSON line per call, with a
1-based call counter persisted in $PROBE_COUNTER) BEFORE this script forms
its response -- that log is independent evidence of what the CLI actually
sent as tool_input on each call, cross-checked against the transcript's own
recorded tool_use.input rather than trusting either source alone.

Required env vars: PROBE_SCENARIO, PROBE_NONCE_FILE (a file OUTSIDE the
project tree holding the nonce value -- the value itself is never placed
in .claude/settings.json's command string, since the model's Read tool can
see that file; only the file's path, which does not contain the nonce
value, appears there), PROBE_LOG, PROBE_COUNTER.
Scenario-specific: PROBE_REDIRECT (R2 only).
