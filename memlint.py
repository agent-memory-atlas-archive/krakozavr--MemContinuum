"""memlint.py -- docs/SCHEMA.md section 7 linter for MemContinuum store markdown.

Rules implemented, a subset of docs/SCHEMA.md section 7:

  * a link whose ruling.authority is owner-verbatim/owner-ratified with no
    ruling.text and/or ruling.source            -> error
  * a link with status: superseded and no superseded_by                -> error
  * a link with reverses: set and no reason_for_change                 -> error
  * frontmatter `current`, if present, must equal the newest link whose
    status is active; mismatch names the correct value                -> error
  * a topic in area processing/* or deletion/* with no code_refs       -> warning
  * any status / authority / kind value outside the five/five/five
    enumerated in docs/SCHEMA.md section 3                                  -> error
  * a topic's `standing:` pointer names a link not in that topic, not
    active, or not owner-verbatim/owner-ratified (TOP-0132 L2)        -> error
  * a topic's `standing:` pointer whose link's ruling.text has a CR/LF -> error
  * the store-wide `standing:` set exceeds 24 links or 4,800 bytes
    (UTF-8) of the complete digest                                    -> error

Exit 1 if any error was found anywhere under ROOT (warnings alone -> exit 0).

Task A2-1 (TOP-0122 L1 rule 3) adds a second, independent mode:
`memlint.py --against-ref REF [--staged] ROOT` checks the append-only
history invariant instead of the schema rules above -- see
`check_append_only` and `main`'s dispatch for the full contract.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cited commit / file:line verification (docs/SCHEMA.md sec7/sec9 addendum;
# INC-0124 -- "invented commit subjects" is the one class of fabrication that
# is mechanically checkable: a source:/evidence: entry naming a commit can be
# verified against the wired code repository's history, the same way
# code_refs/implemented_by are already verified against paths above). Gated
# on code_roots exactly like lint_concept's own checks: nothing here is
# checkable with no root, and both lint_topic's and lint_record's citation
# pass are skipped entirely when code_roots is empty -- no line is printed
# about citations at all in that case (never noise for a store that never
# asked for this check).
#
# THE RECOGNIZER IS THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY (see module docstring's design
# note): this store's own evidence carries many hex-looking tokens that are
# NOT commits -- 16-hex snapshot hashes, sha256 prefixes, session ids,
# render fingerprints, TOP-xxxx ids, dates. Three independent, narrow
# patterns, not one greedy one:
#
#   (a) COMMIT/MERGE-triggered, subject-eligible: a hex run immediately
#       preceded by "commit " or "merge " -- the only two words this
#       schema's own §3 example pairs with a quoted subject
#       (`commit a1b2c3d "the exact subject"`) -- MAY also carry a claimed
#       subject right after it.
#   (b) AT/AS-triggered, subject-INeligible: a hex run immediately preceded
#       by "at " (as in "gate on PR #18 at f7fe011") or " as " (as in
#       "merged as 87663ec") -- this store's own terse cross-reference
#       words, which never carry a subject in real use. Deliberately never
#       subject-eligible even when a quote happens to follow (fix round,
#       Opus MINOR): this store's owner-verbatim convention often puts a
#       quote of the OWNER'S words shortly after ANY kind of reference --
#       "...gate at af95af2 "Codex is back, use it rather than Opus""
#       quotes the owner about something unrelated, not the commit's
#       subject -- and treating that as a subject claim produced a false
#       ERROR (the real commit's actual subject never matches an
#       unconnected owner quote). Splitting the subject-eligible grammar
#       out of the at/as alternative entirely, rather than trying to
#       pattern-match "which quote is real," is what fixes this class
#       outright instead of chasing one fixture.
#   (c) BACKTICK-wrapped: a hex run inside `` `...` `` with no context word
#       at all (a reviewer note quoting a bare hash) -- also never
#       subject-eligible, for the same reason as (b).
#
# ALL THREE shapes require the hex run to be EXACTLY 7 or 40 characters
# long -- git's two canonical hash lengths (abbreviated short form, full
# form) -- enforced with a trailing \b so a longer OR SHORTER run (an
# 8-hex near-miss, a 12-hex render fingerprint, a 16-hex snapshot hash, a
# 40+ non-hash token) never partially matches at either length: this store
# carries `` `e28e83a8` `` (8-hex) three times and none of them are read as
# commits. This is what keeps the recognizer precise rather than greedy:
# verified against this project's own real store (2026-09-19), it is what
# correctly EXCLUDES "rendered by 118974ef7600 against an engine at
# 049884e8b2ed" (INC-0117 evidence; both 12-hex, both render fingerprints,
# "at" is a trigger word but the length gate rejects them) while still
# catching every real 7-char commit hash the store cites through
# "commit "/"merge "/"at "/" as ".
#
# A CLAIMED SUBJECT (branch (a) only) must be a double-quoted string on the
# SAME LINE as the hash, separated only by spaces/tabs, and containing no
# newline itself -- both restrictions exist for the same reason (fix round,
# Opus MINOR): the original `\s*"..."` used `\s` (matches newline) and `.`
# implicitly via `[^"]` (also matches newline), so a YAML `|` block scalar
# -- which preserves real newlines -- let "commit X" bind to a completely
# unrelated quoted sentence many PARAGRAPHS later, as long as no other `"`
# appeared first. `[ \t]*"[^\n]*"` makes both directions of that
# impossible: a hash and its subject must share one physical line.
#
# THE QUOTE CAPTURE IS GREEDY TO THE LAST `"` ON THE LINE (fix round,
# second pass, MINOR): a real commit subject can itself contain a quote
# (this repo's own history has several -- `git log --format=%s | grep -c
# '"'` is 8 as of this writing), and a NON-greedy `[^"\n]*` stopped at the
# FIRST inner quote, so `commit abc1234 "Fix the "foo" parser"` captured
# only `Fix the ` -- an unconditional ERROR against the real subject,
# exactly the false-accusation class this whole feature exists to avoid.
# `[^\n]*"` (greedy, backtracking only as needed) matches to the LAST `"`
# on the line instead, so an inner quote survives intact. Residual known
# miss: two SEPARATE quoted strings after one hash on one line
# (`commit abc1234 "real subject" and also "an unrelated quote"`) still
# over-captures everything between the first and the last quote as one
# claimed subject -- not solvable without knowing which quote is the
# subject and which is unrelated prose, the same fundamental ambiguity
# that motivated restricting subject-eligibility to commit/merge triggers
# in the first place. Not observed in this store's real citations today.
#
# KNOWN MISSES, by design, not oversight:
#   - a bare hash with NO context word and no backticks ("...fixed by
#     e21bfa0 the same day") is invisible -- the whole point of requiring a
#     trigger is refusing to guess that an arbitrary hex-looking word is a
#     commit.
#   - "against <hash>" (used by this store's own append-only NOTE lines,
#     e.g. INC-0124's own evidence) is not a trigger word, on purpose: this
#     store already uses "commit "/"at " for a CITATION and "against" for
#     describing a git compare, and folding "against" in would flag prose
#     that names a ref, not a claim about that ref's authenticity.
#   - an ordinary ENGLISH WORD that happens to be exactly 7 characters, all
#     drawn from a-f, is indistinguishable from a short hash once it
#     follows "at "/"as " -- "deadbee" and "acceded" are both valid
#     lowercase hex AND plausible prose (Grok fix-round finding). Not
#     solvable by the recognizer (it cannot know English from hex); a false
#     positive here reads as an unresolved WARNING, never an ERROR, unless
#     --strict-citations is set for a store that promises never to do this.
#   - a BACKTICK-wrapped 40-hex token is indistinguishable by design from a
#     sha256 (or other 40-hex) prefix that is not a commit at all -- a
#     40-character hex string could be either, and there is no mechanical
#     way to tell them apart without resolving it (which is exactly what
#     this checker then does; a non-commit 40-hex string simply reports as
#     an unresolved WARNING, same as any other miss).
#   - a hash quoted alongside `hash: rest-of-sentence` (no context word
#     before the hash) is invisible -- see (a)/(b) above; this is
#     deliberate, not a gap discovered late.
#   - a comma- or second-colon-separated line locator ("progress.md:86,89",
#     "file.py:123:45", a "-"-joined range "file.py:123-130") -- only the
#     FIRST number after the first colon is ever checked; the citation
#     format this schema documents is one path, one line.
#   - `file.py:L123` (an "L"-prefixed line number, a shape this store does
#     not use but some do) is invisible -- the line-number group requires
#     bare digits immediately after the colon.
#   - only a DOUBLE-QUOTED string immediately following a commit/merge hash
#     -- same line, spaces/tabs only in between, see above -- is treated as
#     a claimed subject. A parenthetical, a colon-joined sentence, or a
#     quote separated by other punctuation is never read as a subject
#     claim -- this store's real citations never quote a subject this way
#     today, so being strict here costs nothing on the real store and
#     avoids inventing a subject out of unrelated prose that happens to
#     follow a hash.
#   - a citation to a commit or a file:line that is real but lives in a
#     DIFFERENT repository than the one --code-root points at resolves to
#     NOTHING here, indistinguishably from a fabricated one -- this checker
#     has exactly one code root's worth of ground truth and cannot tell the
#     two apart. That is why "not found" is a WARNING by default (worded
#     "unverifiable, not necessarily wrong") rather than an ERROR: an ERROR
#     it cannot substantiate is a false accusation. --strict-citations
#     promotes it anyway, for a store known to cite only the wired repo.
#     See the shipping report for the real instances this surfaced against
#     this project's own store.

# colon, never a bare path glued to it). The backslash exclusion (fix
# round, Grok MINOR) closes a separate hole: `\` was in neither the path
# character class nor this lookbehind, so a Windows-style
# "hooks\missing.py:3" matched starting right after the backslash,
# silently citing "missing.py" -- a real, different file at the store
# root, if one happened to exist there -- instead of correctly matching
# nothing at all (this store's own paths are always forward-slashed, so a
# backslash immediately before a candidate path is never legitimate).
# The `~` exclusion (fix round, second pass, NIT) closes the same class of
# hole as the backslash one: `~/dev/three.py:4` used to match starting
# right after the `~`, capturing `/dev/three.py:4` -- which then read as
# an ABSOLUTE path and produced an "is absolute" ERROR naming
# `/dev/three.py`, a path nobody actually wrote. `~` immediately before a
# candidate path is now excluded the same way `\` already is.
# KNOWN MISS, not fixed here (no specific repair requested; the citation
# format this schema documents assumes no spaces in a path): a path
# containing a literal space ("my t.py:123") still matches only its
# suffix after the space ("t.py:123"), the same "silently take a
# basename" shape as the backslash case, for the structural reason that
# nothing marks where such a path starts. Only the FIRST line number of a
# "path:123-456" or "path:123,456" citation is captured -- a range's or
# list's remaining numbers, and an "L"-prefixed line number
# ("file.py:L123"), are known misses (see module comment above). A
# Windows drive-letter path ("C:/x/three.py:1") is SILENTLY not a
# citation at all, the same class as the backslash miss: the colon right
# after "C" is excluded from the lookbehind the same way any other bare
# colon is (this store's own "field: value" YAML convention), so nothing
# ever starts matching partway through it either. A "version 0.2.0:1" or
# "v0.2.0:3"-shaped token (a version number, not a path, followed by a
# colon and a small integer) reads as a file:line citation -- ".2.0"
# satisfies the dotted-extension requirement -- and resolves to a WARNING
# (not found), never an ERROR, unless --strict-citations is set.

    standalone-record pass: scans `source` (a single free-text string, e.g.
    ruling.source) and `evidence` (a list of free-text strings) for commit
    and file:line citations and verifies each against `code_roots`. `prefix`
    is everything the caller wants before the citation's own description
    (already includes the file path and, for a link, its id). Returns
    (errors, warnings) -- one string per mismatch, naming the field/index,
    the citation, and what went wrong.

    UNVERIFIABLE vs SUBSTANTIATED (coordinator ruling, 2026-09-19, after this
    checker's own real-store run surfaced a topic that legitimately cites
    another project's installer files, and INC-0124 citing an IceKEY commit):
    with a single --code-root, "does not resolve" cannot be told apart from
    "lives in a different repository" -- an ERROR for that case is a false
    accusation the checker cannot back up. So a citation that resolves to
    NOTHING under any configured root (a hash cat-file cannot find; a file
    that is not found at all) is a WARNING by default, worded "unverifiable,
    not necessarily wrong" -- and promotes to an ERROR only when `strict` is
    set (--strict-citations, for a store whose records are known to cite
    only the wired repo). A SUBSTANTIATED mismatch -- the hash resolves but
    the quoted subject differs; the file exists but has fewer lines than
    cited -- stays an ERROR unconditionally: the checker verified something
    concrete and it was wrong, which is exactly the fabrication class
    INC-0124 exists to catch, not a stylistic nit. An absolute-path citation
    is also always an ERROR, strict or not: it violates the "relative to a
    code root" citation shape categorically, independent of which repository
    anything lives in, so there is nothing unverifiable about it.

    Skips the commit-hash half of the check entirely when NONE of
    code_roots is a git repository (the file:line half still runs -- it
    needs only the filesystem). When several code_roots are given, a hash
    is accepted if it resolves under ANY git root (content-addressed, so
    "found in two roots" is not the ambiguity code_refs/implemented_by
    guard against for a plain path) and a file:line citation is accepted if
    it exists under ANY root.

    Roots are `.resolve()`d up front, exactly like lint_concept's own
    `resolved_roots` -- caught on macOS CI (Grok/first-CI-run finding): a
    root under a path with a symlinked component (macOS's own
    `/var` -> `/private/var`, which is where `tempfile.mkdtemp()` lands)
    made `full.relative_to(root)` raise ValueError even for a file that
    plainly exists under it, because `full` was resolved (following the
    symlink) while `root` was not -- a real file:line citation was then
    reported as "not found" purely from that mismatch, not from the file
    actually being absent."""

    `warned_uncheckable`, so the identical "markers not checked" warning

    text -- ruling 144, TOP-0122 L4) is an ERROR; an uncheckable file is a
    WARNING naming the reason (rule 2), deduped per absolute path across
    the whole run; a symbol whose name is present but that the chunker
    reports no declaration for (a container type, or ruling 144's
    unverifiable case -- a Swift protocol requirement, say) is also a
    WARNING, deduped per (file, symbol) via `warned_symbol_unverifiable`;
    a checkable symbol with no marker is the plain WARNING rule 5 names.

    Round 2b (NIT 4): when this file has no chunker AND direction 1
    already earned it a held-back attribution warning (`full` is a key of
    `chunkerless_pending`), the generic per-file "markers not checked (no
    chunker for this file's language)" line would only repeat the same
    fact that file-level warning already carries -- this ref's own line
    instead names ITS symbol specifically (never deduped against another
    (topic, link) pair naming the same file: each is a genuinely distinct
    record needing its own answer), and the file is recorded in
    `chunkerless_covered` so `lint_markers` never also appends the
    held-back generic warning for it."""

# closes that: when a link's PARSED fields survive unchanged, its RAW BYTES
# -- the exact text span from its `  - link: Ln` line through the last line
# belonging to that list item -- must also survive unchanged, or the commit
# is refused as a reformat, not an append.
#
# The extraction below works on the file's LINES, never on a re-serialized
# form of the parsed dict (that would just reintroduce the same bug one
# layer down -- confirmed empirically: `yaml.safe_dump` renders sequences
# INDENTLESS and keys `sort_keys`-first, so a naive `  - link:`-anchored
# regex scan returns nothing on exactly the file this check exists to
# catch). Instead it locates each link's span STRUCTURALLY, by indentation,
# and identifies WHICH span belongs to which link id by ZIPPING the
# structural item order against the already-parsed `links` list in the same
# file order -- YAML never reorders a list, so the Nth structural item is
# the Nth parsed link, regardless of how that item's own lines are styled
# or ordered internally. `len(items) != len(parsed_links)` is the one
# consistency check available without re-deriving ids from a dumper of our
# own, and it is treated as "cannot safely say", not "unchanged": see
# `_link_raw_spans`'s docstring and check_append_only's fail-closed handling

    through the last line belonging to that item, i.e. every following
    line indented no shallower than the item marker itself. `parsed_links`
    is the SAME file's already-parsed `links` list (file order); spans are
    assigned to ids POSITIONALLY (see module comment above), never by
    regexing an id back out of the raw text -- immune to quoting, key
    order, and (YAML always preserves list order) reordering.

    A trailing space after `links:` (`.rstrip()`, not `.rstrip("\\n")`) and
    a `#`-comment line at any indent (attributed to whichever span is
    already open, never mistaken for the first content line, an item
    marker, or a boundary) are both tolerated -- PR #22 gate finding
    (MAJOR, both reviewers): either used to bail the WHOLE FILE to a NOTE,
    permanently turning the byte layer off for every link in it, on a
    perfectly valid YAML shape.

    Returns None -- "cannot safely say", never "unchanged" -- whenever the
    structure will not support that positional zip with confidence:
      * no top-level `links:` key on its own line (frontmatter missing,
        or `links` written as an inline flow list -- no real store file
        does this, but this function must not guess if one someday does)
      * the first real (non-blank, non-comment) line under it is not a
        list-item marker (`- `) at some consistent indent
      * the number of structurally-found items does not exactly match
        `len(parsed_links)` -- e.g. a REF-side duplicate id that
        `_recovered_old_links` already resolved to one entry still shows
        up as two structural items; rather than guess which structural
        item the surviving parsed entry corresponds to, this bails and
        the caller falls back to parsed-field comparison alone for that
        file (append-only is still enforced, just not the byte layer) --
        this is the one bail-out this fix round did not close; the caller
        turns it into a NOTE (never silent -- see check_append_only)
      * any parsed link's own `link` id is missing/unhashable, or two
        parsed links resolve to the same id string (would silently drop
        a span otherwise)

    Known limits (TOP-0129 L1 -- a guard is a claim until demonstrated,
    not a result): a YAML block scalar (`|`/`>`) whose continuation lines
    happen to dedent to the item marker's own column would be mis-split
    (no store file uses block scalars today -- confirmed by a corpus
    grep, not assumed); a blank line immediately after an item attaches
    to that item's OWN span, not to whatever follows it, so inserting a
    blank line inside recorded history (with nothing else touched) is
    correctly flagged as a reformat, not silently ignored.

                     with --staged, it means the INDEX -- what `git commit`
                     would actually commit. A link's body present at REF
                     must be unchanged; its three lifecycle fields --
                     status, superseded_by, promoted_by -- may each move
                     forward once. A link removed, or a topic file deleted
                     or renamed, is an error. New links, and changes to
                     current/title/tags/code_refs/standing/the body text outside a
                     link, are free. A REF that never parsed is repaired
                     (a note, not an error) when the new side now parses
                     cleanly -- there is no recorded link history to
                     freeze on a blob that was never validly a record.
                     REF must not start with "-" (it would otherwise
                     swallow the next flag, e.g. --staged, as if it were
                     the ref). --code-root is rejected together with
                     --against-ref (append-only mode never uses a code
                     root). Exit 1 on any append-only error; exit 2 if
                     ROOT is not inside a git repository or REF does not
                     resolve to a commit.
  --staged           compare REF to the INDEX (what `git commit` would
                     actually commit) instead of the working tree (the
                     default).
